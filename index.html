          <h2>Obesity Rates in America</h2>

          (BRFSS) during the year 2017 were collected. The chart below proves that the U.S. population are affected by obesity, 
          in that one common findings that exists is that all or virtually all low-income states are far more likely to show signs 
          of obesity. Each marker in this chart represents an individual state in the USA, and as you hover your mouse over by state, 
          the tooltip will display data accordingly by percentage.</p>

          <p>Data on Obesity standsout in America, and it is a staggering public health crisis, and therefore, it is worth mentioning that one
          of the many obvious culprits we come accross with every day are the super-sized drinks, processed foods and its obscene portion sizes
          widely available in the market.</p>
